    Parameters
    ----------
    workspace_root : Path
        Root directory of the rstest-bdd workspace whose manifests are rewritten.
    version : str
        Version string applied to patched dependency entries.
    include_local_path : bool
        Toggle whether rewritten dependencies retain their relative path entries.
    crates : tuple[str, ...] | None, optional
        Subset of crates to update; default rewrites every crate with
        replacements.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        All matching manifests are rewritten in place.

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        Raised when any supplied crate lacks a replacement configuration or a
        manifest cannot be rewritten due to a missing replacement entry.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> apply_workspace_replacements(Path("."), "1.2.3", include_local_path=False)
