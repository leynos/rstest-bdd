## Macro implementation: fixture classification and normalization

Fixture name normalization happens during macro expansion, before generated
wrappers ask the runtime context for fixture values. This keeps scenario-side
fixture registration and step-side fixture lookup on the same key scheme, so an
implicit parameter such as `_world` registers and resolves as `world`, while
`__world` resolves as `_world`.

The helper `normalize_param_name()` owns that rule. Use it whenever macro code
derives a fixture key from a Rust parameter name without an explicit override.
Keeping the rule centralized avoids one side of macro expansion stripping a
leading underscore while another side keeps it.

Step wrapper argument classification is handled by
`classify_by_placeholder_match()` in the macros crate. The function first
checks whether the argument maps to a step placeholder. If it does not, the
argument is classified as a fixture. For implicit fixture arguments, it records
the normalized fixture name so the generated wrapper asks for the same key that
scenario fixture registration produced.

Explicit `#[from(...)]` names are authoritative and bypass normalization. Use
that escape hatch when the intended fixture name starts with an underscore or
otherwise differs from the Rust parameter name. When the classifier must build
a new identifier for a normalized implicit fixture name, preserve the original
parameter span so diagnostics still point at the user-written parameter.

## Internal test infrastructure

The async semantic behaviour tests use a shared support module at
`crates/rstest-bdd/tests/common/async_semantic_behaviour_support.rs`. Use the
helpers and types below when writing or extending semantic tests; do not access
`TEST_STATE` directly.

### Constants

| Constant              | Value / purpose                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FEATURE_PATH`        | Relative path (from `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`) to the async semantic behaviour feature file. Pass to `assert_feature_path_suffix` and as `ScenarioRef::feature_suffix`. |
| `SKIP_SCENARIO_NAME`  | Canonical name of the skip-propagation scenario. Use wherever a scenario name is required for that scenario.                                                       |
| `ERROR_SCENARIO_NAME` | Canonical name of the error-propagation scenario. Use wherever a scenario name is required for that scenario.                                                      |

### Parameter structs

Prefer struct-literal syntax at call sites so that each field is labelled.

#### `ScenarioRef<'a>`

Bundles the two string fields that identify a scenario in assertion helpers.

```rust
ScenarioRef {
    name:           ERROR_SCENARIO_NAME,
    feature_suffix: FEATURE_PATH,
}
```

Fields: `name: &'a str`, `feature_suffix: &'a str`.

#### `StepRef<'a>`

Bundles the four string fields that identify a step in failure-context
assertions.

```rust
StepRef {
    keyword:       "When",
    text:          "a step fails with an error",
    function_name: "step_that_fails",
    handler_error: "deliberate failure",
}
```

Fields: `keyword: &'a str`, `text: &'a str`, `function_name: &'a str`,
`handler_error: &'a str`.

#### `BypassedStepQuery<'a>` _(requires `diagnostics` feature)_

Bundles the four fields needed to look up a bypassed-step record in the
diagnostics registry dump.

Fields: `scenario_name: &'a str`, `scenario_line: u32`,
`step_pattern: &'a str`, `reason: &'a str`.

### Helper types

#### `SemanticValue(i32)`

Newtype wrapper for an integer fixture value. Used to verify that async step
handlers can return a value that is injected as a fixture into subsequent steps.

#### `CleanupProbe`

A zero-size marker struct whose `Drop` implementation increments the per-thread
`cleanup_drops` counter. Inject it as a fixture and call
`reset_cleanup_drops()` before the scenario under test, then assert
`cleanup_drops() == 1` after it completes (or after `catch_unwind` returns for
failure paths).

### Assertion helpers

#### `assert_feature_path_suffix(actual, expected_suffix)`

Asserts that `actual` ends with `expected_suffix` using `Path::ends_with`.
Panics with a descriptive message on mismatch.

#### `assert_handler_failure_context(message, ScenarioRef, StepRef)`

Normalizes `message` (converts backslashes to forward slashes, strips Unicode
directional marks) and asserts it matches a regex covering the step keyword,
step text, function name, handler error, feature path suffix, and scenario
name. Panics on regex compile failure or mismatch.

#### `assert_bypassed_step_recorded(BypassedStepQuery)` _(requires `diagnostics` feature)_

Dumps the diagnostics registry, parses it as JSON, and asserts that
`bypassed_steps` contains an entry matching all four fields of the query.
Panics if no matching entry is found.

### Event utilities

| Function                           | Purpose                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clear_events()`                   | Resets the per-thread event log. Call at the start of any test that reads events. |
| `push_event(event)`                | Appends a string to the per-thread event log. Call from within step handlers.     |
| `snapshot_events() -> Vec<String>` | Returns a clone of the current event log without clearing it.                     |

### Cleanup utilities

| Function                   | Purpose                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reset_cleanup_drops()`    | Resets the per-thread drop counter to zero. Call before the scenario under test. |
| `cleanup_drops() -> usize` | Returns the number of times `CleanupProbe` has been dropped in this thread.      |

### Line-number utility

#### `scenario_line(scenario_name) -> u32`

Reads `FEATURE_PATH` relative to `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, scans for a `Scenario:`
or `Scenario Outline:` heading whose name matches `scenario_name`, and returns
the 1-based line number. Panics if the scenario is not found. Use this instead
of hard-coded line numbers so that tests remain valid when the feature file is
edited.

### Thread-local state and test isolation

All mutable state (`events`, `cleanup_drops`) is held in a single
`thread_local! { RefCell<TestState> }`. State is per-thread and does not leak
between concurrently running threads. Any test that reads from or writes to
shared state must:

1. Call `clear_events()` and/or `reset_cleanup_drops()` at the start.
2. Be annotated with `#[serial]` to prevent interleaving with other
   tests on the same thread pool.
